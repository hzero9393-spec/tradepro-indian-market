        <p>If we introduce any premium features or paid plans in the future, the following refund policy will apply:</p>
        <SubSection title="2.1 Subscription Refunds">

            <li>Processing time depends on your bank/payment provider</li>
          </ul>

      </Section>

      <Section title="3. Virtual Money & In-App Purchases">
        <p>TradePro uses virtual money that has no real-world value. Important points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Virtual money (₹1,00,000 starting balance) cannot be purchased, sold, or transferred for real money</li>
          <li>Virtual profits and losses have no financial value</li>
          <li>If we introduce any virtual goods or features, they are non-refundable and non-transferable</li>
          <li>Resetting your account will restore your virtual balance to ₹1,00,000 at no cost</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section title="4. Account Deletion & Data">
        <ul>
          <li>If you choose to delete your account, all your data (virtual balance, trades, positions) will be permanently removed</li>
          <li>Since no real money is involved, there is no financial settlement upon account deletion</li>
          <li>Data deletion is irreversible — you cannot recover your trading history after account deletion</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section title="5. Technical Issues & Compensation">
        <p>If you experience technical issues that result in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Loss of virtual data due to platform errors (not user action)</li>
          <li>Incorrect trade execution due to system bugs</li>
          <li>Extended platform downtime affecting your trading</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Contact us at support@tradepro.app and we will work to resolve the issue. For the free tier, compensation will be in the form of account adjustments or extended features, not monetary refunds.</p>
      </Section>
